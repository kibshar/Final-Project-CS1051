#### What have you done for your project so far?

I made a GUI and created 2 modules for learning python so far for loops and if statements

#### What have you not done for your project yet?
I still need to finish 4 other modules/create teaching material for them, try to make the GUI change in real time to responses from questions, figure out if its possible to run python in the GUI


#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

The biggest issue I'm dealing with right now is that I want to code the teaching modules as functions, but the issue is that when you would naturally require a response to something like a question you can't ask for an input. Thats primarily because its a chatbot and its always taking input so i have been trying to get around that by making each input i need to be prompted for in a specific way but it honestly makes it very confusing and hard to follow the code. If i can even manage to code the other 4 modules without the whole thing exploding I would consider that a win,
