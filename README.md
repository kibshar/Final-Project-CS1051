Final Project for CS 1051

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

I have a few ideas that I was thinking about doing for the final project drawing inspiration for project ideas from this site https://data-flair.training/blogs/data-science-project-ideas/ 

Idea 1: Diagnosing Diseases from Given Datasets Using Machine Learning

Essentially expanding on this project https://data-flair.training/blogs/python-machine-learning-project-detecting-parkinson-disease/ using XGBoost these people were able to develop a machine learning paradigm to detect Parkinson's when they inputed patient data. My expansion on this project would be to use the same paradigm but expanding to other diseases such as Alzheimer's, Huntington's, etc. The goal is that just by importing a CSV file with sample patient data and running the program the following conditions are met
  1. The program can identify what dataset the input relates to i.e was the patient only tested for Alzheimer's or just Parkinson's or both?
  2. The program given the input can correctly identify whether the results of the data indicate that the patient has the disease 
  3. If the patient is diagnosed with a disease the program outputs a new table that only has the names of the patients and their diagnosed diseases i.e John Smith, Parkinson's

Idea 2: Making A ChatBot that can teach coding

Drawing inspiration from this project https://data-flair.training/blogs/python-chatbot-project/ in which they created a chatbot that had healthcare applicatoins, I would use a similar method to create a chatbot that could be used to teach instead. I would like to make a generative based chatbot, but I think in this case a retrieval based chatbot makes the most sense, and essentially I would take all the major topics that we learned this semester and make a chatbot that would be able to teach them to a student that wants to learn them. Bascially a chatbot Professor Rosen. 
The goal is that the ChatBot is able to:
  1. Explain major concepts discussed in course i.e for loops, if statements, Regular expressions, IDE's explain basics on how to use IDLE, pycharm and Visual Studio, file reading, etc
  2. Provide examples of working code for each of the major topics
  3. Be able to answer some common questions


## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

Working by myself

## Do you have any questions of your own?

I would prefer to work on Idea 1 but if you think its too much work to do in this time frame then I would be ok with Idea 2 which is less conceptual work but probably more tedious work
